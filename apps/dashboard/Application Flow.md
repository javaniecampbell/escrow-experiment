You can follow a similar pattern to update the AddMilestone, InitiatePayment, ReleaseFunds, and DownloadAsset components to use the Zustand store.


## Application Flow:


Now, let's establish the flow for your escrow service:

Project Creation: Users can create new projects using the "Create Project" form. This form adds projects to the Zustand store.

Milestone Management: Users can add milestones to projects using the "Add Milestone" form. These milestones are associated with the selected project in the store.

Payment Initiation: Users can initiate payments for milestones associated with a project. The Zustand store can track which project and milestone are selected.

Release Funds: Funds can be released for completed milestones. Users select a completed milestone, and the funds are released.

Download Assets: Users can download assets associated with milestones. The Zustand store can store the expiring asset link.

By integrating Zustand, your components can easily access and update the shared state, ensuring that your escrow service flows smoothly. Feel free to adapt and extend this flow according to your specific requirements.

### Client View Section

All right, great. Now I want the client view. I'd want to have the client be able to see their site. What are the subjected components and sections that you think we need to include for the client side?
ChatGPT
To create a client view for your escrow service, you'll need components and sections that allow clients to interact with their projects, view milestones, preview assets, and request payouts. Here are the suggested components and sections for the client view:

1. Dashboard: The main dashboard where clients can see an overview of their projects, project statuses, and balances.

1. Project List: A list of the client's active projects, including project names, statuses, and balances.

1. Project Details: When a client selects a project, they can view detailed information about that project, including milestones, milestone statuses, and available actions.

1. Milestone List: A list of milestones within the selected project, showing milestone names, descriptions, statuses, and balances.

1. Preview Asset: Similar to the preview component on the admin side, this component allows clients to preview downloadable assets or websites associated with milestones.

1. Release Asset: Clients can use this component to release the escrowed funds for specific milestones after previewing the asset.

1. Request Payout: This component enables clients to request payouts for completed milestones.

1. Client Profile: A section where clients can view and update their profile information.

1. Notifications: A section where clients can receive notifications about project updates, milestone completions, and payouts.

1. Payment History: Clients can view their payment history, including details of transactions and payouts.

1. Support and Help: A section where clients can access support resources and get assistance if needed.

1. Logout: An option for clients to log out of their accounts.

These components and sections will provide clients with a comprehensive view of their projects, milestones, and actions they can take within the escrow service. You can customize the UI/UX based on your specific requirements and design preferences.

### Project Management

Did we include everything that we need for the project management of all the project management needs and all the things I've described earlier?

**ChatGPT**

Based on the components we've implemented so far, we've covered the following aspects of project management for clients:

1. Client Dashboard: The dashboard provides an overview of the client's projects, their status, milestones, and previews.

1. Client Projects: Clients can view a list of their projects, and we've added the ability to view more project details through a modal.

1. Client Feedback: Clients can provide feedback on their experience and completed projects.

1. Client Logout: Clients can log out of their account.

1. Client Support: Clients can contact support for inquiries or issues.

> Interations & Actions

The implementation I provided is a starting point for managing client data, projects, billing history, and support messages. However, it doesn't cover all the components and actions associated with the client view in your application. To ensure a complete response, let's list the components and the sections of the store associated with each:

 Client Dashboard:

1. Client data: Manages client information (e.g., name, email).
2. Projects data: Manages the list of projects associated with each client.
3. Billing history data: Manages billing history entries for each client.
4. Support messages data: Manages support messages sent by clients.

Client Projects:

1. Projects data: Manages the list of projects associated with each client.
2. Selected project: Stores the details of the selected project.

Client Feedback:

- N/A (No specific store section needed for this component).

Client Logout:

- N/A (No specific store section needed for this component).

Client Billing:

- Billing history data: Manages billing history entries for each client.

Client Support:

- Support messages data: Manages support messages sent by clients.


> While the store implementation I provided covers client data, projects, billing history, and support messages, it's essential to note that actions and interactions specific to each component may require additional store sections and logic. 

> Actions such as adding new projects, sending support messages, or providing feedback should be implemented separately in your components.
