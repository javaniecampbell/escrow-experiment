You can follow a similar pattern to update the AddMilestone, InitiatePayment, ReleaseFunds, and DownloadAsset components to use the Zustand store.


## Application Flow:


Now, let's establish the flow for your escrow service:

Project Creation: Users can create new projects using the "Create Project" form. This form adds projects to the Zustand store.

Milestone Management: Users can add milestones to projects using the "Add Milestone" form. These milestones are associated with the selected project in the store.

Payment Initiation: Users can initiate payments for milestones associated with a project. The Zustand store can track which project and milestone are selected.

Release Funds: Funds can be released for completed milestones. Users select a completed milestone, and the funds are released.

Download Assets: Users can download assets associated with milestones. The Zustand store can store the expiring asset link.

By integrating Zustand, your components can easily access and update the shared state, ensuring that your escrow service flows smoothly. Feel free to adapt and extend this flow according to your specific requirements.
